# SelfPointMassageApp
### My WWDC24 Swift Student Challenge Win Submission

SelfPointMassageApp is an iOS application designed to introduce common acupoints and provide guidance on acupressure massage based on discomfort symptoms. The app utilizes SwiftUI for its user interface and incorporates AR functionality to visualize acupoints in real-world settings.

## Core Functionality

- **Introduction to Acupoints:** Explore and learn about common acupoints used in acupressure massage.
- **Symptom-Based Search:** Search for acupoints based on discomfort symptoms, allowing for personalized massage guidance.
- **AR Visualization:** Employ AR technology to place 3D models of acupoints in the user's environment, providing a visual reference for massage locations.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Implement SwiftUI features such as navigation, popover, sheet, and list for a user-friendly experience.

## Open Source Resources

- **FocusEntity:** This repository leverages the open-source FocusEntity library ([GitHub](https://github.com/maxxfrazer/FocusEntity)) to enhance AR capabilities, enabling plane detection and precise placement of 3D models.

## Purpose and Support

The inspiration behind SelfPointMassageApp is to provide assistance to elderly family members who often experience bodily discomfort or symptoms. By offering information on acupoints and acupressure massage techniques, the app aims to minimize reliance on medication and doctor visits, promoting natural methods for symptom relief and improved well-being. Though the project is currently in its initial stages, the ultimate goal is to empower users with accessible and effective self-care solutions.
